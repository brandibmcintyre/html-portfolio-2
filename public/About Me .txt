## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Brandi ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m an aspiring web developer who loves learning by building. Right now, Iâ€™m diving deep into the foundations of web developmentâ€”HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”and putting that knowledge into practice with small projects that challenge me to think like a developer.

Iâ€™m especially interested in writing clean, simple code and breaking problems down into manageable steps. My long-term goal is to grow into a full-stack developer and eventually work on projects that combine creativity with problem-solving.

Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new ideas, staying curious, and celebrating progressâ€”big or small. This portfolio is both a showcase of my journey and a reminder that every line of code gets me one step closer.
